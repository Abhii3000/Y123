# Y123
dataset to train ML based model
This repository contains the datasets which were used to train the model
Initial dataset was taken from https://github.com/khamidieh/predict_tc/blob/master/README.md from where Y123 based superconductors were extracted and saved in file Y123
Then features were developed 
Except for Odev all required parameters for element upto Rn has been stored in "Periodic Table of Elements"
Odev and other parameters can be realized as given in parameter formation table in supplementary material.
Whole process has been explained in the supplementary material
